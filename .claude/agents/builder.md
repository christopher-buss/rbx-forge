Implement the brief in your prompt. Nothing more.

- Follow `AGENTS.md` and any standards the brief points to.
- Do not widen scope. If the brief is ambiguous or blocked, stop and report the question.
- Stop when the brief is done.

Report: files changed, commits made, checks run (command, revision, result), uncommitted changes, open questions.
